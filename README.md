# Frontend Dev CS

Here is my project ! âœ¨

I spent : 
- 3-4h on the entire project without TypeScript.
- I spent a few more hours setting up and typing everything in TypeScript as it was my first time using it. 

Bonuses & Pluses : 
- [x] Bonus to any UI library based on React JS : [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [x] Bonus to use React functional components : React Hooks
- [x] Use HighCharts library for pie charts : use of HighCharts with a [React wrapper](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts-react#readme)
- [ ] Add infinite scrolling for table results. Can use any library for your framework (had ideas but wasn't sure of what you wanted exactly)
- [ ] Implement sorting on columns : I sorted alphabetically before rendering inside the table, but I think you wanted a sorting option when clicking on the column header, I realised it a bit late (the instruction wasn't explicit enough for me)
- [x] Use NPM for dependency management (node version : `v16.15.1`)
- [x] Add basic CSS layout

I hope we'll get the chance to discuss about it ! ðŸ˜„
